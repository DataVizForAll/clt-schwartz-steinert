          <h2>Introduction: </h2>

          <p class="lead">The US housing market in late 2024 is facing a variety of challenges, primarily centered around rising home prices and diminished affordability. Among the biggest obstacles today is the ongoing issue of home affordability. Over the past several years, home prices have increased significantly due to factors like rising mortgage rates and inflationary pressures. As mortgage rates climb, borrowing becomes more expensive, significantly impacting new homebuyers’ ability to afford homes. This, combined with the already-high home prices, has created a situation where fewer people are able to purchase homes. </p>

          <p>Another significant issue is the limited housing supply, particularly in desirable urban and suburban areas. Homeowners are less motivated to sell their properties, especially considering the low mortgage rates they secured in previous years. This "lock-in effect" has contributed to the tight housing market. Builders, meanwhile, are facing significant challenges related to supply chain shortages and increased construction costs, further exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing options.
</p>

            <h3> The Struggle for Affordability </h3>

          <p> As affordability continues to be a growing issue, the gap between home price growth and wage stagnation is widening. Over the past few decades, home prices have dramatically outpaced wage increases, making homeownership increasingly difficult for low- and moderate-income families. In response to this, institutions like Community Land Trusts (CLTs) have emerged as a strategy to address the affordability crisis. 
    A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a nonprofit organization that holds and manages land on behalf of a community with the goal of ensuring long-term affordability and sustainability. CLTs prevent land from falling into the speculative real estate market, which can drive prices up. Instead, the land is retained by the trust, while homeowners own the buildings on the land. This arrangement significantly reduces the overall cost of homeownership, making it more accessible for families who might otherwise be priced out of the market.
 </p>

          <h3> USA Homes </h3>

          <p> We will focus on a specific CLT program enacted in 1992, Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc. (USA). USA Homes, which we will refer to as homes owned by Urban Suburban Affordables, is a key affordable housing program created through a collaboration between the Christian Activities Council (CAC) and the Hartford Housing Authority. Launched in 1992, the program was designed to help reduce the cost of homeownership for low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers. USA’s initiative revolves around acquiring parcels of land and then leasing them to eligible families purchasing homes located on those parcels. This strategy is part of a broader effort to help more people afford homes, particularly in areas where rising prices have made homeownership a distant dream for many. By maintaining control over the land, USA can help ensure that housing remains affordable for future generations while allowing current owners to build up wealth, a vital aspect of addressing long-term affordability.
</p>

          <h3>Our Objective</h3>

          <p>To understand how effective CLTs like Urban Suburban Affordables are in maintaining long-term affordability, it's important to examine various factors, such as home prices, property values, and neighborhood stability. This research could focus on several key aspects, including: 
Current Home Prices vs. Initial Purchase Prices: By comparing how much homes in USA’s land trust are selling for today versus their original purchase price, we can assess whether the homes have remained affordable over time. 
Property Turnover and Resale Trends: The frequency of buying and selling within the CLT can provide insight into homeownership stability. If properties are frequently resold, it may suggest a lack of long-term stability, whereas fewer sales might indicate a stronger sense of community and ownership. 
Neighborhood Impact: Understanding how USA’s CLT affects the broader community can offer insights into how well it helps stabilize the local housing market and foster resilient, thriving neighborhoods. 
The goal of this research is to measure the trends and sale prices of USA’s Homes, and its impact on the affordability and stability of Hartford’s housing market, and potentially offer lessons for other cities considering similar initiatives. These findings could also provide valuable feedback to the Center for Leadership and Justice, informing improvements or adjustments to their own affordable housing programs.
