          <h2>Introduction: </h2>

          <p class="lead">The US housing market in late 2024 is facing a variety of challenges, primarily centered around rising home prices and diminished affordability. Among the biggest obstacles today is the ongoing issue of home affordability. Over the past several years, home prices have increased significantly due to factors like rising mortgage rates and inflationary pressures. As mortgage rates climb, borrowing becomes more expensive, significantly impacting new homebuyers’ ability to afford homes. This, combined with the already-high home prices, has created a situation where fewer people are able to purchase homes. </p>

          <p>Another significant issue is the limited housing supply, particularly in desirable urban and suburban areas. Homeowners are less motivated to sell their properties, especially considering the low mortgage rates they secured in previous years. This "lock-in effect" has contributed to the tight housing market. Builders, meanwhile, are facing significant challenges related to supply chain shortages and increased construction costs, further exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing options.
</p>

            <h3> The Struggle for Affordability </h3>

          <p> As affordability continues to be a growing issue, the gap between home price growth and wage stagnation is widening. Over the past few decades, home prices have dramatically outpaced wage increases, making homeownership increasingly difficult for low- and moderate-income families. In response to this, institutions like Community Land Trusts (CLTs) have emerged as a strategy to address the affordability crisis. 
    A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a nonprofit organization that holds and manages land on behalf of a community with the goal of ensuring long-term affordability and sustainability. CLTs prevent land from falling into the speculative real estate market, which can drive prices up. Instead, the land is retained by the trust, while homeowners own the buildings on the land. This arrangement significantly reduces the overall cost of homeownership, making it more accessible for families who might otherwise be priced out of the market.
 </p>

          <h3> USA Homes </h3>

          <p> We will focus on a specific CLT program enacted in 1992, Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc. (USA). USA Homes, which we will refer to as homes owned by Urban Suburban Affordables, is a key affordable housing program created through a collaboration between the Christian Activities Council (CAC) and the Hartford Housing Authority. Launched in 1992, the program was designed to help reduce the cost of homeownership for low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers. USA’s initiative revolves around acquiring parcels of land and then leasing them to eligible families purchasing homes located on those parcels. This strategy is part of a broader effort to help more people afford homes, particularly in areas where rising prices have made homeownership a distant dream for many. By maintaining control over the land, USA can help ensure that housing remains affordable for future generations while allowing current owners to build up wealth, a vital aspect of addressing long-term affordability.
</p>

          <h3>Our Objective</h3>

          <p>Ultimately, we want to uncover how USA Homes homeownership trends, sales prices, and property characteristics evolved over time in West Hartford and East Hartford. To understand how effective CLTs like Urban Suburban Affordables are in maintaining long-term affordability, it's important to examine various factors, such as home prices, property values, and neighborhood stability. This research could focus on several key aspects, including: 
Current Home Prices vs. Initial Purchase Prices: By comparing how much homes in USA’s land trust are selling for today versus their original purchase price, we can assess whether the homes have remained affordable over time. 
Property Turnover and Resale Trends: The frequency of buying and selling within the CLT can provide insight into homeownership stability. If properties are frequently resold, it may suggest a lack of long-term stability, whereas fewer sales might indicate a stronger sense of community and ownership. 
Neighborhood Impact: Understanding how USA’s CLT affects the broader community can offer insights into how well it helps stabilize the local housing market and foster resilient, thriving neighborhoods. 
The goal of this research is to measure the trends and sale prices of USA’s Homes, and its impact on the affordability and stability of Hartford’s housing market, and potentially offer lessons for other cities considering similar initiatives. These findings could also provide valuable feedback to the Center for Leadership and Justice, informing improvements or adjustments to their own affordable housing programs.

<p>The graph above depicts a visualisation which highlights the increase in value of the home when it was purchased comparatively to its current market value on Zillow. The blue that is represented in each column is the sale price to USA homes while the orange directly above it represents how much the price has grown or its current value. Astonishingly, there was an average increase in value of 515% with the median increase in value being 335% across the 10 randomly selected properties from West Hartford, with the most significant increase being 2296% increase while the least significant increase was 189%. The graph below depicts the same comparison for our random East Hartford properties, where we saw an average of 143% increase across the 10 randomly selected properties with the most significant increase being 349% while the leaset signficant increase was 57.35%. Across all examples, there is a consistent increase in property prices, reflecting a significant rise in the housing market over time. The magnitude of the price increase varies, with some properties experiencing steeper growth than others. The average sale price for homes in the US grew 231% since 1990s while the median sales price grew 431% since 1990s, while the median sale price of homes in CT grew 140%. West Hartford homes outperformed East Hartford homes in relation to both average and median percent increase as well as the median sale price in CT, while East Hartford homes shared a similar growth to median sale price in CT.</p>

  <p> 
 Thes two charts above show the East Hartford and West Hartford Assessor data for a set of 10 random USA homes in town. Accessor prices, set by local governments, reflect the official assessed value of a property for tax purposes, based on factors like location, size, and condition, and are generally updated annually or biannually. Unlike Zillow's estimated market value, which is based on recent sales data and market predictions, accessor prices may not always reflect the current market value. Analyzing accessor prices every few years helps track changes in property values, offering insights into local tax assessments, potential market trends, and long-term investment opportunities. Understanding this data is crucial for understanding market behavior and making informed decisions regarding investing in real estate.  </p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>

<p> Through private data that was shared with us from the Center for Leadership and Justice, we were able to choose 10 randomly selected properties within East Hartford and West Hartford that USA homes owned. From these 10 randomly selected properties, we accessed their respective Zillow property listings as well as Online CT Assessment Database listing to pull data regarding each property's current value, its sale history, as well as its government land assessment valuations. We noticed there seemed to be a discrepancy between certain data that was provided by Zillow when compared to government data, and so when possible we resorted to using government data over the data provided by Zillow. We inputted all the data we found from our randomly selected properties and began compiling data that could then be turned into visualizations. </p>
